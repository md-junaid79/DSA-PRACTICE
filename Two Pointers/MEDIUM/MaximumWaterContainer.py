'''
Q.) You are given an array of integers where each element represents the height of a vertical bar. You may choose any two bars to form a container. The width of the container is the distance between the two bars, and its height is determined by the shorter of the two bars. 
Write a function to return the maximum amount of water that can be stored in such a container.
Example:
Input: [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49
(The container formed by the bars at indices 1 and 8 stores the maximum water: width = 7, height = 7, area = 7 Ã— 7 = 49.)
