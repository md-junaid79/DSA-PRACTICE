'''There are n cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.
You are given:

An integer target representing the destination mile.
Two arrays, position and speed, both of length n:
position[i] is the starting mile of the i-th car.
speed[i] is the speed of the i-th car in miles per hour.
A car cannot pass another car but can catch up and travel next to it at the slower car's speed, forming a "fleet".

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
Example 1 :
target :12
position :[10, 8, 0, 5, 3]
speed :[2, 4, 1, 1, 3]
Output 1 :3

def carFleet (target,position,speed):   
    cars=sorted(zip(position,speed),reverse=True)      #sort by position in descending order.
    stack=[]
    
    for pos,spd in cars:
        time=(target-pos)/spd                          # time taken by cars
        
        if not stack or time>stack[-1]:         #if stack is empty or current car takes more time than last car in stack.If a car behind takes longer (time > stack[-1]), it cannot catch up â†’ it forms a new fleet.
            stack.append(time)          #add the time to stack as a new fleet because the new car also takes same time as the last car in stack [fleet].
    return len(stack)  


    
print(carFleet(target=12, position=[10, 8, 0, 5, 3], speed=[2, 4, 1, 1, 3]))  # Output: 3
